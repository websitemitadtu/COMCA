                                  Honestly, this is one of the most asked questions and I hope your doubts will be cleared after reading this.
                                    The end goal of every data science project is to deploy the project in production. So, no matter how
                                    accurate your model is, it is still incomplete without the last step as we will be discussing it further in the
                                    article. <br> <br>
                                    To write a high and good quality code that wonâ€™t cause havoc during the production stage, it is necessary
                                    to know the basics of some of the software engineering subjects like â€“ basic lifecycle of software
                                    development projects, data types, compilers, time-space complexity, etc.<br>
                                    Writing efficient and clean code will help you in the long run and help you collaborate with your team
                                    members. Again, you donâ€™t need to be a software engineer but being clear with the basics will help you.
